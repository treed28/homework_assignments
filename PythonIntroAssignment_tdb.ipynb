You can find a recording of their \"Introduction to Python\" course on their [training archive](http://www.hpc.lsu.edu/training/archive/tutorials.php), as well as a link to interactive \"slides\" that can be used in a similar way to learnpython.org.\n",

The [pyplot tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py) gives you an introduction to many of the things you might want to do with `pyplot`, but for now we'll make the simplest possible plot.

There are many ways to do this, but for now, please write code that meets the following requirements.\n",
